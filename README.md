This repository demonstrates a common off-by-one error when iterating through a C++ `std::vector`.  The error occurs because the loop condition `i <= vec.size()` attempts to access the element at index `vec.size()`, which is one past the valid range of the vector. This can lead to undefined behavior and crashes.  The solution shows the correct way to iterate using `i < vec.size()`.
